Every two or so weeks I like to share some new-ish release games that I've been playing. A lot of them are from the world's premier platform for weird little indie games, Itch.io, but I also find games on Steam and Good Old Games too. I do try to pick newer games, since I want to shine a spotlight on the games people are making *right now*, but I will occasionally throw in games that might be between a few weeks to a few months old too depending on how long it takes me to get around to a game that piques my childlike wonder.

## Haneko's Late Homework

Detritus is scattered across every surface, voices softly whisper to you from dark corners and if you're particularly unlucky you'll encounter an \*Anomaly\*. Haneko's Late Homework is a short survival horror game that was made for the Anomalous Entity Jam. With some clear inspiration taken from classics like Silent Hill, you'll fight with fixed camera angles and some wonky controls but the game is dripping with a desolate flavour that captures that early PS1 feel. The core gameplay is basic, but given the length of the game it doesn't outstay its welcome. It's unforgiving, but can be completed in around 10-20 minutes.

By far the most interesting part is the map which has several doors that will take you from one side of the map to the other. I thought I was travelling between floors and rooms but when it clicked I was able to outmanoeuvre the Anomaly using Haneko's innate ability to fold time and space. If the Anomaly does catch Haneko, you'll witness the unfortunate end for someone's (presumably) beloved Furaffinity OC. Haneko's Late Homework is completely free, though let the record show that I did pay around $5 Australian smackaroos as an optional "pay what you want" price.

## Aether Diving

Loading into Aether Diving you're greeted by an old friend, an MSDOS command line interface. Shortly after a few splash screens play and the title screen appears with one of the freshest tracks I've heard in gaming this year. The only shortcoming is how short it is, but small miracles.

The gameplay here is kind of reminiscent of an old Flash game more than a DOS game, I was able to beat it pretty easily and there's never much danger of failing as it's not very challenging gameplay. The art is surreal, the same can be said for pretty much everything else about Aether Diving too. It's short, it's free, it reinvigorated my Chakras.

## Clickolding

A bit over a month old now, but I still think about this game a lot. It doesn't seem like the kind of game to leave an impact but it does. There's not much to say about Clickolding that wouldn't spoil it, so I'll keep this brief. A grimy hotel room, a man wearing a mask and an old clicker. The game ratchets up the tension at times and is remarkably unsettling throughout.

The parallels to sex work are obvious and Strange Scaffold has delivered something that is in equal parts absurd and thought provoking. Also, click goes clicky ha ha. Sorry I almost got a bit too pretentious there talking about a game where you click a guy off in a hotel room.

## Dungeons of Hinterberg

Full review of this game is currently in progress, will ideally be released in the days following this article. Dungeons of Hinterberg has finally realised my dream of... going on a fucking holiday. You may not know this, but I haven't been on a holiday since I left high school almost ten years ago. That's a long time to not be on a holiday. It's also a trend that may not change for some time yet, since I've added this website and part time game development onto my workload too. What? You want to hear about the game? Fine. Dungeons of Hinterberg nails that \*holiday\* vibe, something I haven't felt since I was very young. There's a very laid back vibe blanketing the entire world, even when you're exploring dungeons and fighting baddies. Exploring a town as a tourist, finding landmarks, visiting attractions, meeting new people. It does all this in a surprisingly grounded fantasy backdrop. The world is magical and mysterious but feels simultaneously real. Dungeons are all excellently designed with puzzles that make you feel smart when you solve them but aren't so hard to make you pull up a walkthrough. Groups of dungeons will sometimes have a central theme or "gimmick" like minecarts which are always a welcome addition to any game I play.

 Combat starts off relatively simple but as you unlock more abilities and spells enemies will start to get tougher making you think a lot more about how you approach encounters. The art style is cute and whimsical, and it's also a delight to play on the Steam Deck given how little power it draws with its stylised cel shaded graphics. Little touches like gusts of wind blowing leaves through across a mountain make me want to take a deep breath in like I can actually taste the clean, crisp air our protagonist, Luisa, must be enjoying.

The synth-heavy music can vary between really beautiful to just okay. In general, the ambient music and themes are all great and fit the mood perfectly. Combat music can feel a bit out of place against the rest of the tracks, which is my only complaint about the music. The writing can leave something to be desired, which is a shame because there is a fair chunk of dialogue and reading in this game too. I think most of the characters are fun to interact with but there stuff I'd much rather be doing like exploring the world and delving into dungeons.

That's probably just me though, since I don't really get into the social elements of games like Persona either. All of that aside, games like this were the inspiration for Just Good Games, and I can't think of a better game to christen this blog with. Microbird games are a small team who have accomplished something massive, a thousand kudos to everyone over there in Vienna.

That about wraps up the first ever post on this blog. I still have a few things to clean up, and I doubt anyone is reading this yet because I'm not planning on promoting the blog until I'm happy with its presentation, so never. If you do stumble onto this mayhaps in the future, I hope you have a wonderful rest of your day and that the future isn't to harsh on us. I hope I'm writing things that you enjoy reading and I above all I hope that I'm still as in love with video games as I was when I started this.
