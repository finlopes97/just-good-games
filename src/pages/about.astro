      <p>
        I'm Kyle, I love games. That's all there was to it for a long time, now I
        have this blog with which I hope I can shine a light onto games that I
        think are <strong>JUST GOOD GAMES</strong> <em>(I said the thing).</em> This is a passion project,
        so don't expect fancy stuff like a reasonable release schedule for reviews
        and posts. I balance this, among other projects like working on my own
        games, with a full time job. I mention this because if you're like me,
        juggling a boatload of uncontrollable and/or self-inflicted
        responsibilities, then you can rest assured that when I say a game is
        worth the time it's really worth it.

      <h2 class="text-xl text-left font-heading mt-4">How I Write.</h2>
      <p>
        reviews in such a way that they're like asking a friend what a game is
        like. I want to evoke the feel of a game and what it's like to play
        through my words and give you a sincere glimpse into my own experiences.
        I'm not a robot, anything I write will have an inherit bias based on my
        personality and opinions. If I say something you don't agree with, that's
        just the way it goes sometimes.
      </p>

        Schedule and content I plan on posting.
      </h2>
      <p>
        as regularly as my free time permits: reviews of games I have enjoyed,
        posts about games I am looking forward to and general articles about stuff
        I find interesting that's tangentially related to video games.
