2024 was jam-packed with gamesâ€”so many, in fact, that I didn't even have time to write about them on this blog. Yeah, let's go with that. From excellent remakes to breakout indie phenomena, 2024 had it all. It was a big year for JRPGs with Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, Dragons Dogma 2 and Metaphor: ReFantazio. Balatro took the world by storm, and we even got the first decent Indiana Jones storyline since Fate of Atlantis. S.T.A.L.K.E.R 2 beat the odds and managed to release despite its troubled development, UFO 50 reminded me why I don't like NES games and Helldivers 2 showed us some of the best explosions in gaming, ever. 

That's just some of what happened this year in gaming, a lot more happened, not all of it good. Layoffs continue to affect real people in the industry the world over. Corpo cunts continue to miss the mark with a hyper fixation on making the next live service money printer, telling gamers to get used to not owning their games. A culture of toxicity that predicates itself on driving engagement through controversy and negativity shows no sign of slowing down. 

But fuck all that. We're here to talk about good games, the best games even, for 2024. Starting off with:

## Honourable Mentions

### Fallout London

This is my website and my rules, so I could have included this in my true top ten, but even I have to have standards. Fallout London is an incredible feat, a mod for Fallout 4 that's as large as some big-budget AAA games. It's not the first mod to include a lot of content or a big open world, but it's the first one I've played that does so with such consistently high quality. Everything from the art, the design, the writing and voice acting; all of it, a monument to what the modding scene is capable of. It even attracted celebrity guest performances such as Sylvester McCoy and Colin Baker. Fallout London is an incredible accomplishment and it's all made for ***FREE***.

### Judero

If it wasn't for some really severe technical challenges I experienced with Judero, this would no doubt make it onto the list. Bursting at the seams with personality and utterly unique, Judero is an epic tale that wears its cultural influences on its sleeve. It's also an inherently weird game, which swaggers between tales of Scottish folklore to contemporary portraits of fascism, environmentalism, the role of law, and anything else its seemingly self-aware characters deign to spin a yarn about. The moment-to-moment gameplay was mildly frustrating at the best of times and a bit boring at the worst and its technical performance is unfortunate, but this is still a game worthy of a look simply for its one-of-a-kind experience.

### Clickolding

One of the biggest surprises of the year, for me at least, was when the Among Us developers announced that they were publishing a game about clicking a clicker in a seedy hotel room while a mysterious figure in a disturbing mask watches from an armchair in the corner. It's an experience that sticks with you, for better or worse. Hopefully, we see more weird little games that take around an hour to beat that can worm their way into your brain like this one did with me.

### 10. Dungeons of Hinterberg

A supremely relaxing jaunt around some Austrian mountains. Dungeons of Hinterberg is part Persona, part Zelda and part Diablo. You can wander around town and build up your relationships with a crew of other dungeon-delving thrill seekers or the mild-mannered townsfolk. You can explore open-world areas and find secret chests to loot, enemies to battle, spots to relax and while away the hours or portals to mysterious dungeons filled with mystery. 

![A woman with red hair standing on a snowy ledge looking out over a vista of snow capped cliffs](/images/posts/doh_08_iceoverworld.jpg "A Snowy Paradise")

The dungeons are the meat of the game, with each area offering a unique mechanic for its dungeons to utilise which creates this focus on fun and inventive level design. The environments are gorgeous, full of little details like leaves being swept away in a gust of wind, or grand set-pieces like a snowy descent you can conquer on a hoverboard. The game makes fun a priority at every step of the way, I've even come to appreciate the character moments a bit more even if I found them lacklustre when I first played through Dungeons of Hinterberg. I've written about this game more extensively in my actual review which is available \[here].

### 9. Helldivers 2

Come on you apes! You wanna live forever? It might have taken yonks but in the last few years, we've actually gotten some decent Starship Troopers inspired games. Technically we got one licensed Starship Troopers game in the form of 2023's Extermination, which was fine, but it simply cannot hold a candle to the over-the-top, hyper-cinematic, tall glass of Liber-tea that Helldivers 2 has to offer. So many moments from this game feel like they could be the best moments from a more tightly scripted, expertly directed experience. Precise airstrikes clobbering towering behemoths while you and three of your fellow Helldivers scramble to hold off a horde of bugs long enough for an extraction ship to pick you up; a thermonuclear device detonating in the distance while you rampage around in a mech suit; diving away from so, so many explosions. 

![A soldier in futuristic armour coated in yellow and green alien blood shoots up at a staggeringly tall behemoth.](/images/posts/scn92e.jpg "I'm from Buenos Aires and I say kill 'em all!")

Once things ramp up, and they always do, Helldivers 2 delivers pure adrenaline. Thankfully too, progression wasn't bogged down by microtransactions even though it easily could have given the game's structure; it even makes the best use of its live service shenanigans to create ongoing in-universe events that bring thousands of players together to fight for a common goal. Helldivers 2 is better than it has any right to be and managed to grab my attention even as someone who doesn't really play a lot of multiplayer (and especially live service) games.

### 8. Path of Achra

A lo-fi, low fantasy roguelike which I've been messing around with for the better half of the year. Path of Achra is a testament to the roguelike genre, runs are short, build variety is ridiculous and every win or loss feels like progress. I'm not the biggest fan of most roguelikes, but Path of Achra's commitment to player freedom and its Conan-inspired world sets it apart. If you thought Balatro, and I have nothing against Balatro, but if you thought Balatro had the juice for your dopamine addiction then you haven't seen what a single late-game turn in Path of Achra has to offer you. 

![A top down perspective of some pixel art sprites on a grid, it's animated, a being walks towards other beings creating a wake of fire in its path.](/images/posts/warriora.gif "Heat from fire, fire from heat.  ")

In my last run, any action I took whether it was moving, attacking, praying or even standing still would deal ice damage in a radius around me to all enemies, teleport me across the screen, and then spawn several snakes which would slither off and attack even more enemies as the impact from my teleportation dealt a wave of astral damage around me. Any time an enemy died, would then in turn heal me. If you think it sounds like it's too easy to cheese, well even on that blessed run one wrong move ended it all. The combat log moves insanely fast, damage numbers fly across the screen and any loot you find has the chance to make you an unkillable god *if* you know how to use it. It's an immensely satisfying experience, and it's my go-to roguelike for short bursts on my Steam Deck. There is no greater honour.

### 7. Content Warning

"Wait" you may say "better than Helldivers 2?!" you may cry. You're right, it's definitely an odd choice. It takes a lot for me to get sucked into a multiplayer game. Helldivers 2 had the juice, it's an excellent sandbox of chaotic explosions, murder and mayhem; but one game this year did something really weird. I don't know if you know this about me, but weird stands out and me likey weird. Content Warning presents as a vision into humanity's future as emotionally starved psychopaths who will do anything for social media clout. In other words, 2024. 

![A gray world with a hideous monster being filmed on camcorder, a giant wheel spins in the background powering something unknown.](/images/posts/1.png "FUCKFUCKSHIT FILM-THAT FUCK")

You're armed with a video camera and a small selection of other gadgets that can assist you in your journey to internet stardom. With three other friends (or strangers), you delve into the horrific ruins of the old world. Here you'll find traps, monsters and rare artifacts. Your goal? To film these things, especially when your friends are screaming in terror or are being eaten by horrible creatures. Then you return home, upload it to the internet and watch the views roll in. This game makes you into a monster, who sees your friend strung up by a ceiling trap about to be killed and instead of helping you get your camera out and start filming. The other genius feature of this game is that you can save these videos on your actual computer. At its peak, Content Warning's Discord had hundreds of these clips shared in it, a lot of them were absolute gold. It's unfortunately not as active as it was earlier in the year, but it's a game I'll be thinking about for a long time.

### 6. Dread Delusion

If you take Warhammer 40k and Morrowind, you get Dread Delusion. This game is a trip, an enigmatic one at that. It's not as difficult as some classic RPGs like Morrowind but it doesn't hold your hand either in the best and worst ways. Some almost essential items, like the compass, can be easily missed. The combat is very basic and with a limited variety of weapons, it can turn stale fast. Like a lot of my favourite games, there's something greater underneath despite these flaws. Dread Delusion has a remarkable world, an inventive levelling system that doubles down on exploration, good and often witty writing; it's a game you can get lost in. 

![Another hideous monster, this time a hunchback with a demon mask, covered in shaggy black fur.

Its retro-style graphics are surreal and dreamlike, your imagination fills in the blanks and it manages to get me more invested than a lot of games with hyper-realistic graphics. This is a world that yearns to be explored, and every inch of it deserves your attention. I am unabashedly thankful for its measure as well, this isn't a long game by any means. It's a condensed open-world experience that respects your time, rewards curiosity, and doesn't overstay its welcome. An excellent indie adventure RPG. 

![Two people on camels riding in a desert, rendered as pixel art, with a cactus and some rocks in the distance, with the text "FIVE." overlayed.](/images/posts/arco-banner.png "Arco")

### 5. Arco

Set in a fantastical version of Mesoamerica rife with magic, cowboys, ancient temples and monsters, Arco is a straightforward revenge story with a satisfying and smart tactical combat system. The combat and RPG mechanics are streamlined and encounters feel frenetic and rhythmic; quick restarts encourage players to experiment. Creativity is rewarded and the approach taken to the quasi-turn-based combat makes everything feel fluid. Turns play out over a few seconds, and you can usually take your time deciding what to do next, whether it's dodging, using a weapon or some other ability. It manages to make it feel different from other turn-based tactical games, especially since you're usually just controlling one character. 

![Two people ride camels through a desert with giant rib bones jutting out of the sand](/images/posts/arco-screenshot-1920x1080-06.jpg "Moments like this create intrigue in the world, what could leave these bones.")

And that's without even touching on the art; Arco has some of the best pixel art I've ever seen, with stunning vistas, bustling towns, hideous monsters and machines, all beautifully designed and lovingly crafted. Almost every screen in Arco made me stop for a moment to just stare and appreciate how gorgeous it is, while they also tell a story all on their own. The music fits the mood, with a few standout tracks that hit at just the right moment as you're exploring an overgrown tomb or fending off a dozen bandits. A remarkable adventure through an unforgettable world. 

![A floating body is suspended in the air with a strange entity on the left, a red glow in the background illuminates them, with the text "FOUR." overlayed](/images/posts/resist-banner.png "1000xRESIST")

### 4. 1000xRESIST

Sometimes a story can only be told through a video game. I have a special place in my heart for games that use the medium to its fullest potential to tell a story. Without giving too much away, 1000xRESIST spins a sprawling yarn about belonging, culture, mental illness, ego, family and so much more. It is a saga, and it is executed extraordinarily well. The writing feels deeply personal, you can tell there's genuine experience behind the words on the screen and the voice acting conveys this consistently and memorably. 

![A woman in blue neon clothing, wearing glasses, angrily looks forward with a text box hovering near her that says "I gave up everything to walk beside you."](/images/posts/1kxr_screenshot_09.png "You're not you when you're hungry.")

1000xRESIST could reasonably be called a *just* walking simulator or *just* a visual novel but to reduce it down to just these things diminishes the mechanical complexity with which it delivers its story. It's a game that puts on a play and invites you to participate on its stage. To be curious and explore, ask questions. To feel happy, sad or even bitter. It does all this in a way that respects the player's intelligence without being overly complicated. Truly a marvel of storytelling, proving that there is still room for innovative narrative design in this medium.

![A man and woman in traditional Japanese clothing face forward, the man in front appears to be protecting the woman, with the text "THREE." overlayed.](/images/posts/gami-banner.png "Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess")

### 3. Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess

I slept on this game for far too long. It really didn't sound like my cup of tea; a hack-and-slash, tower defence, village management game all rolled into one. I am always happy to be proven wrong though, if you can believe it. Kunitsu-Gami is a game that somehow manages to tie all these different elements together in a cohesive way. Capcom didn't stop there though, they also gave the game a distinctive visual style with traditional Japanese influences and beautiful animation. 

![A celebration with a group of people in traditional Japanese clothing cleansing a cursed torii gate. Fireworks are shooting out in the background, and everyone is dancing. A woman in a white robe is in the centre of them all.](/images/posts/scr2mg.jpg "I wish this happened whenever I cleansed defilement in my apartment.")

Combat is a dance, while idle, characters will dance to the beat of a level's music. Each move and ability is delivered with a flourish, everything feels punchy and satisfying. This game would still be *good* if it was just combat; but you also have villagers to manage, who you can assign roles to such as being a melee or ranged fighter which can then be positioned on a map for when night falls and "Seethe" pour out of a defiled Torii game to attempt to halt your advance. Then once you liberate an area, you can assign villagers to repairs in each area which will be carried out while you're on the next stage. It all comes together to make a really fun, in-depth and satisfying game. Plus, you can pet the dogs, cats, cows, pigs, deer, and more I've been told.

![A pixellated little brown creature amongst some reeds and ruins with the text "TWO." overlayed.](/images/posts/animal-banner.png "Animal Well")

### 2. Animal Well

They put kangaroos in this one, and that appeals to my sense of national pride. So then, it is very impressive that even if there were no kangaroos in this game it would still take the number two spot. Animal Well is a super tight platformer/metroidvania with more secrets than the KGB (what a timely reference - Editor Kyle). This is a purely gameplay-driven experience, where every inch of the map is hiding some collectable or power-up.  Almost every screen in Animal Well has some puzzle or challenge to overcome, and each solution leads to yet another delightful problem to solve, like a nesting doll of pure intrigue. 

![A dim, dank place with glowing green vines hanging from suspended platforms over water. A little creature uses a YoYo on the right hand side.](/images/posts/screen_yoyo.png "More games need to incorporate yo-yo's.")

Another standout to me was the audio design; there is no "music," rather, the game utilises background noise to build this dynamic, player-driven symphony when you hop across floating bubbles with expert timing or use a slinky to activate a series of buttons. These moments feel like magic and they stand out so much more than a conventional soundtrack would have done. It doesn't hurt that the game looks gorgeous too, with bright neon colours against its moody deep blue background. Exploring this world and unravelling its secrets was an absolute pleasure and I'm excited to see what the developer does next, and doubly as excited for future projects coming out of Big Mode.

![A themed garbage can in the shape of a crow with some light posts next to it, with the text "ONE." overlayed](/images/posts/crow-banner.png "Crow Country")

### 1. Crow Country

Survival horror has seen something of a renaissance since the release of RE7 in 2017. That's not to say the genre was dead before RE7 but compared to the consistent stream of excellent survival horror games we have now, it was undoubtedly waning. Crow Country is a return to form for survival horror, it touches up the classic formula with modern design choices that make it an absolute pleasure to play. 

![A woman with purple hair and a white dress walks next to an old 80s car towards a locked gate to an abandoned amusement park.](/images/posts/scp62y.jpg "The first puzzle is shooting this lock and I did fail the first time. ")

With an adorable PS1-era-styled aesthetic, each area feels like a small diorama and has its own distinguishing theme. Whether it's an underwater wonderland or a haunted village, each area is a microcosm, chock full of puzzles and tense boss fights. The game leans into its puzzles, feeling more like an adventure game at times, the puzzles are brain ticklers but aren't half as hard as some of the worst the genre has produced. Crow Country even has an emphasis on replayability and speedrunning which I adore, with unlockable weapons and optimal paths to discover. The people you meet along the way are charming and build on top of the lore of the world, sharing tidbits of history that unfold the mystery of what happened at Crow Country. 

![A woman with purple hair sits on an antique couch, watching a fireplace roar in a cozy room filled with trinkets.](/images/posts/scp630.jpg "So, god damn, relaxing.")

The music hits and I am happy to share that the save room music is an all-time soothing melody (as is tradition); the rest of the music captures the melancholy dread that the environments so often inspire. Of all the games I played this year, Crow Country had the most elegant core gameplay and the most striking visual design and it managed to build on top of its survival horror roots to deliver something new. I might just be a sucker for survival horror but for my money, Crow Country takes the cake.

So, that's a wrap on 2024. I might do a follow-up retrospective later which can deal with all the more boring personal shit I want to talk about. I started a blog, abandoned it and returned all in the space of half a year. Impressive, even for someone with my level of ADHD. I still love video games and I still love writing about them, and I want to get better and be more consistent even if only for my own sake. So, hopefully I'll see more of me in 2025 and I can write about even more amazing games. To wrap up, here's an Aussie deep cut reference, as the old host of Rollercoaster TV used to say "goodbye for now, but not forever."
